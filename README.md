# Mesh Improvement via Sampling:

Implementation and results of "A Constrained Resampling Strategy for Mesh Improvement"

# Description:

This is the implementation of the algorithms presented in "A Constrained Resampling Strategy for Mesh Improvement" 
paper on curved surface. This includes the following applictions:
- Non-obtuse retriangulation 
- Mesh Simplification 
- Delauany Sifting 

For more details about the algorithm and applictions, please refer to the paper. Additionally, all input/output models 
presented in the paper are provided under `/data`.

# Installation:

The code has no prerequisites. The code was developed and tested under Microsoft Visual 12.0 C++11. 

- Windows:
	On CMake GUI, set the source code directory to where the CMakeLists.txt is and set the build directory to where
	you would like the project to be. Click `Configure` followed by `Generate`. Go to the build directory, open the .sln
	project	and build it on Release mode. You can run the project from Visual Studio or from command line.
