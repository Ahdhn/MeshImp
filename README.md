# Mesh Improvement via Sampling:

Implementation and results of "A Constrained Resampling Strategy for Mesh Improvement"

# Description:

This is the implementation of the algorithms presented in "A Constrained Resampling Strategy for Mesh Improvement" 
paper on curved surface. This includes the following applictions:
- Non-obtuse retriangulation 
- Mesh Simplification 
- Delauany Sifting 

For more details about the applictions, please refer to the paper. Additionally, all input/output models 
presented in the paper are provided under `\data`. 

# Installation:

The code has no prerequisites. The code was developed and tested under Microsoft Visual C++ 12.0.
